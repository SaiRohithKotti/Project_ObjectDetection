# Project_ObjectDetection
The Real-Time Object Tracking System uses OpenCV and Tkinter to track objects in video streams. Users select an object, and the system tracks it using CSRT/KCF algorithms. Built with Python, it features a simple UI for video display, object selection, and tracking visualization. Ideal for learning computer vision and tracking algorithms.
